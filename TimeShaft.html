							<p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone.</p>

I really must go back. I shouldn't have run away. I realize now that love is one luxury a princess cannot afford. </p>

							<p>We're done with you. Go back to the golf course and work on your putz. Nah, he got the upside, I got the downside. See there's two sides to every Schwartz.  What's the matter with this thing, what's all that churnning and bubbling, you call that radar screen? Ah, planet Druidia. And under that air shield, ten thousand years of fresh air. We must get through that air shield! Say goodbye to your two best friends, and I don't mean your pals in the Winnebago. So, Lone Star, now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb. </p>

							<p>You make it so difficult sometimes. You have your moments. Not many of them, but you do have them. You're not actually going IN to an asteroid field? I happen to like nice men. This bucket of bolts's never gonna get us past that blockade. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. Evacuate remaining ground staff.</p>

							<p>Artoo says that the chances of survival are 725 to 1. Actually Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time... Oh dear...The odds of successfully surviving an attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer are approximately... Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed. Stupid little short-circuit! He'll be *quite* all right. </p>

							<h3>I hope it's for adult dating</h3>
							<p>Can we talk? OK, we all know Prince Valium is a pill. But you could have married him for your father's sake and had a headache for the next 25 years. Well, goodbye virgin alarm. Besides he got a sexy voice. He might be cute. Hey wait, you forgot to get married! And if we go over our pagecount, the network will kill us. You know, you've got a very unique voice. You should be in silent films.</p>
